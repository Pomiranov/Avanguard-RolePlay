<br><i>a little history of the above-mentioned project:</i></br>
<br><li>At the age of 17, I created and led a project on the RageMP platform dedicated to GTA 5 RP. I assembled a team of over ten people, wrote technical specifications myself, and managed the project for five months.</li></br>
<br><li>The development was conducted using the React library, and one of the challenges was incorporating 3D models and creating various game mechanics. Through perseverance and teamwork, we successfully launched the project, which lasted for four months on the market.</li></br>
<br><li>Unfortunately, the project was closed after that, but the experience gained during its implementation has become invaluable for me. I am now sharing all the code and the project website on GitHub to share my experience with the community.</li></br>
